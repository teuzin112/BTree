# BTree
Simple project realized during the discipline Algorithms and Data Structures

This project implements a BST(Binary Search Tree) B tree, where every node have a custom order size. This order size can be defined at the start of the "BTree.h" file.

The idea here is a simple program that registers health professionals in a pseudo-database, utilizing binary files for storing all data. The program generates two binary
files, one for the data that is being stored and the other one for the B tree that is associated with those data.

To run this program simply download all source files and create a project in any IDE and run int.
